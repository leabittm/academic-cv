abstract: "The type A Hecke algebra of rank n is a deformation of the group algebra of the braid group on n strands Bn. This is true in more generality, in particular, the affine Hecke algebra is a deformation of the group algebra of the affine braid group, which can be defined as braids in a (thickened) annulus. As such, the affine Hecke algebra is the braid skein algebra of the annulus. Morton and Samuelson have proved that the Double Affine Hecke Algebra (DAHA) is isomorphic to the braid skein algebra of the punctured torus. They also conjectured that these were isomorphic to the corresponding tangle skein algebra, where braids are replaced by tangles (or ribbons). In this talk, I will present a proof of the Morton-Samuelson conjecture, and a classification of a class of representation of the DAHA using doubly periodic tableaux. This is based on joint work with A. Chandler, A. Mellit and C. Novarini. "
