#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "Quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality gives an equivalence of categories between
certain representations of quantum affine algebras of type A and representations
of affine Hecke algebras, and hence p-adic representations of GLn. Through this
equivalence, certain results can be directly translated between the two domains.
However, when the quantum affine algebra is of low rank, the equivalence may
break down and the translation must then be adapted. In this talk, we will see
several examples of transcriptions of results on p-adic representations to quantum
affine representations. This is partly based on joint work with J-R. Li "
